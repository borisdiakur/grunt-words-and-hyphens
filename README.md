## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `~0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-words-and-hyphens --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-words-and-hyphens');
```

## The "words_and_hyphens" task

### Overview
In your project's Gruntfile, add a section named `words_and_hyphens` to the data object passed into `grunt.initConfig()`.

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  'words_and_hyphens': {
    options: {
      // Task-specific options go here.
    },
    files: [/* glob patterns */]
  }
});
```

### Options

#### options.pattern
Type: `String`

The node module [`words-and-hyphens`](https://github.com/borisdiakur/words-and-hyphens) uses [`hypher`](https://github.com/bramstein/hypher) for hyphenation. In order for it to work, you must install a [hyphanation pattern module](https://github.com/bramstein/hyphenation-patterns) and pass its name in the `pattern` option to `grunt-words-and-hyphens`.

### Usage Example

```js
grunt.initConfig({
  'words_and_hyphens': {
    options: {
      pattern: 'hyphenation.de'
    },
    files: ['some/folder/**/*.txt']
  }
});
```
